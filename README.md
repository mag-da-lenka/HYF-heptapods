  <p class="important">IMPORTANT: I'm going to write a simple page as best as I can. I had the priviledge of getting sick a few days ago so I was not able to google all the cool stuff but I have completed the Khan Academy's Intro to HTML and CSS. I am starting to build the
    webpage but unfortunately I will not be able to finish it today. I will keep working on it on my days off (Wednesday and Thursday). I hope there is still a chance you might like to look at the changes I will make here in a few days. If not, I understand
    and I will definitely apply again! <br>Copenhagen /16th of June 2019

  <h2>Who am I?</h2>

  <p>I am a web developer. ...Oh wait... I am trying to become one. I have been a teacher and a few other things but I would like to change my career path because of the reasons I mentioned in my motivational letter.
  </p>

  <h2>What is my experience in coding?</h2>

  <p>Well... My full experience is about <strong>30 hours</strong> but I will keep learning. I started as <strong>a total beginner</strong>. I literally had no idea what coding is all about but now I understand the „science” behind it and I am <strong>motivated</strong>    to go for more training. I need to add that <span class="important">I went through the intro to HTML and CSS all by myself. I did not ask anyone for help</span> and I did that on purpose. I wanted to test myself so there were no shortcuts, no excuses,
    just note-taking, learning and practicing.
  </p>

  <h2>Do I like coding?</h2>

  <p><strong>Yes!</strong> I have wanted to understand how coding works for a long time. Doing the short course at Khan Academy gave me a lot of satisfaction. The videos are not only informative, but also hilarious so the experience was also great fun. I
    realize this is just the beginning and it will get harder but I don't mind. :)
  </p>

  <h2 class="important">My Khan Academy projects (from least to most advanced... ...I mean "advanced"):</h2>
  <p> Since I am not able to present my final project <strong>yet</strong>, I am linking a few tasks I completed on Khan Academy website.
